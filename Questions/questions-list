1.  Gem Element
    Each rock is composed of various elements and each element is represented by a lower case English letter from 'a' to 'z'. An element can be present multiple times in a rock. An element is called a 'gem-element' if it occurs at least once in each of the rocks.
    Given the list of N rocks with their compositions, display the number of gem-elements that exist in those rocks.

    Sample Input :
    ['abcdde', 'baccd', 'eeabg', 'abcdded', 'abccd', 'abeeg']

    Sample Output :
    2 (only 'a' and 'b' occur in each of the rocks)
